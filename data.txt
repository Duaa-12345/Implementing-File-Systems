Test file1 to check import.
Test file2 to check import.
Hello WOrld. Welcome to my file system.
iF you want to have your own virtual hard drive then first delete the files named as 'jsonParser.txt','data.txt','fatTable.txt'. This will give u access to create ur own vhd.
this vhd uses the following commands : cd,ls,mkdir,rmdir,import,quit.
In the 'jsonParser.txt' file json shows the parsed version with keys having no value,dictionary value, integer value as per requiremnt.
by default vhd directory is set to 'root'.
'data.txt' stores the imported files.
